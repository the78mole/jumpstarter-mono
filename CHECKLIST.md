- [x] Setup linters (ruff, golangci-lint, clippy)
- [ ] Test unified build orchestration

### Monorepo Consolidation

- [x] Create renovate configuration for dependency management
- [x] Consolidate VSCode settings and extensions
- [ ] Centralize GitHub Actions workflows (create reusable workflows)
- [ ] Remove duplicate dependabot configurations
- [ ] Remove duplicate devcontainer configurations
- [ ] Consolidate license files
- [ ] Consolidate contributing documentation
- [ ] Add Helm ingress `none` option for custom configurations
- [ ] Migrate remaining poetry configurations to uv

## Phase 4: CI/CD Integration

- [x] Setup change detection for efficient builds
- [x] Configure automated testing
- [x] Setup release automation
- [x] Configure package publishing

### Build Optimization
- [x] Implement build caching
- [x] Setup dependency caching
- [x] Optimize pipeline performance
- [x] Configure parallel builds

## Phase 5: Documentation and Cleanup

### Documentation
- [ ] Consolidate all documentation â†’ `docs/`
- [ ] Update README files
- [ ] Create migration guide
- [ ] Setup documentation building (MkDocs)
- [ ] Create component API documentation

### Testing and Validation
- [ ] Run full integration test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Developer workflow testing
- [ ] Documentation review
- [ ] Validate firmware build process
- [ ] Update hardware documentation
- [ ] Review and update architecture diagrams
- [ ] Validate and test consolidated documentation

### Cleanup
- [ ] Archive old repositories (create archive branches)
- [ ] Update external references
- [ ] Community communication
- [ ] Update package registries

## Phase 6: Development Environment Setup

### Local Development
- [ ] Create a devcontainer setup to support development and testing
  * [ ] Based on ubuntu-24.04-image
  * [ ] Using devcontainer features for common tooling (python, go, rust)
  * [ ] Add local features for special tooling
  * [ ] Integrate k3d for local Kubernetes testing
  * [ ] Include pre-configured VSCode extensions

### Validation
- [ ] Validate local builds
- [ ] Validate local testing
- [ ] Validate local linting
- [ ] Validate local documentation generation
- [ ] Validate local action workflow (act)
  * [ ] Conditionals for action changing or pushing artifacts (use `{ ! ENV.act }` to mask)
  * [ ] Workflow file for building each component
  * [ ] Workflow file for running linters
  * [ ] Workflow file for running tests
  * [ ] Workflow file for documentation generation
  * [ ] Workflow file for publishing
  * [ ] Workflow file for stitching together the above, indidually for PRs (checking) and main branch (icl. publishing)
  * [ ] PR branches shall also publish artifacts to registries, but not as a release, so you can use e.g. images for testing, before approving the PR

## Phase 7: Create jumpstarter-server
- [ ] Create `jumpstarter-server` component
- [ ] Integrate with existing components, but replaces the controller and router
- [ ] Setup API endpoints for core functionality
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
  * [ ] Minimal/Mock OIDC setup, but shall be attached to keycloak or other OIDC provider
  * [ ] Default setup (compose) shall include controller and router
  * [ ] Router can be started separately and registers at a configured controller
  * [ ] Controller will distribute routing loads to available routers
    - [ ] First simple round-robin
    - [ ] Later more advanced routing (e.g. based on load, etc.)
- [ ] jumpstarter-server configuration shall be based on the same config file structure as the controller
  * [ ] Additionally introduced configuration elements (e.g. for router registry) shall be compatible with kubernetes controller (shall ignore unknown config elements)
- [ ] Kubernetes objects shall be replaced by internal datastructures of the server (controller-piece)
  * [ ] Possible migration to redis or other database in the future
- [ ] Create documentation for jumpstarter-server
- [ ] Create integration tests for jumpstarter-server
- [ ] Validate jumpstarter-server functionality
- [ ] Integrate jumpstarter-server into CI/CD pipeline

## Phase 8: Release and Migration

### Final Validation
- [ ] All components build successfully
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline works end-to-end
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### Migration Communication
- [ ] Announce migration to community
- [ ] Update package repositories
- [ ] Update documentation links
- [ ] Provide migration guide for users

### Post-Migration
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Collect community feedback
- [ ] Address migration issues
- [ ] Archive old repositories

## Quick Verification Commands

After each phase, run these commands to verify progress:

```bash
# Repository structure
tree -L 3

# Build verification
make build

# Test verification  
make test

# Lint verification
make lint

# Documentation verification
make docs
```

## Rollback Plan

If migration encounters critical issues:

1. **Immediate**: Revert to individual repositories
2. **Short-term**: Fix specific issues in monorepo
3. **Long-term**: Complete migration with lessons learned

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All components build in <30 minutes
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Developer setup time reduced
- [ ] Documentation consolidated
- [ ] Community can contribute effectively
- [ ] Release process simplified

**Implementation Status**: ðŸŸ¢ In Progress - Phase 2 Complete (Migration Done)

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 3 build system integration - address remaining tool dependencies

**Estimated Completion**: 4 weeks remaining
