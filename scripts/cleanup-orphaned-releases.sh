# cleanup-orphaned-releases.sh - Clean up releases that point to non-existent commits
#
# This script identifies GitHub releases that reference commits that no longer exist
# in the repository (e.g., after squashing commits) and optionally deletes them.
#
# Usage:
#   ./cleanup-orphaned-releases.sh [--dry-run] [--force]
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run    Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
#   --force      Delete without confirmation prompts
#
