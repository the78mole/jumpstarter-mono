# GitHub Actions Run Cleanup Script
# Deletes old workflow runs, keeping only the most recent ones
#
# Usage: ./cleanup-runs.sh [-y] [KEEP_COUNT]
#   -y: Skip confirmation prompt (auto-confirm deletion)
#   KEEP_COUNT: Number of runs to keep (default: 20)
#
# Examples:
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh        # Keep 20 most recent runs (with confirmation)
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh -y     # Keep 20 most recent runs (no confirmation)
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh 50     # Keep 50 most recent runs (with confirmation)
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh -y 50  # Keep 50 most recent runs (no confirmation)
