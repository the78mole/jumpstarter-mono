# Jumpstarter Protocol

The Jumpstarter Protocol defines the gRPC-based communication layer for the [Jumpstarter](https://jumpstarter.dev) Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) ecosystem. It enables seamless, secure, and scalable interaction between clients, the Jumpstarter Service, and exporters‚Äîwhether they are interfacing with physical or virtual hardware, locally or remotely.

## Overview
Jumpstarter Protocol provides a unified gRPC interface for:

- **Clients** to control and monitor remote/local hardware
- **Exporters** to expose hardware interfaces over gRPC
- **Jumpstarter Service** to route and manage connections

Thanks to gRPC‚Äôs support for HTTP/2, streaming, and tunneling, the protocol works efficiently across enterprise networks, VPNs, and cloud environments. It appears as standard HTTPS traffic, making it compatible with existing security infrastructure.

## Features
- üîå **Unified Interface:** Interact with virtual or physical hardware through a consistent API.
- üîê **Secure by Design:** Leverages gRPC over HTTPS for encrypted communication.
- üåê **Flexible Topology:** Supports direct or routed connections via the Jumpstarter Router.
- üì° **Tunneling Support:** Can tunnel Unix sockets, TCP, and UDP connections over gRPC streams.
