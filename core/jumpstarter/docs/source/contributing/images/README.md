# Architecture Diagrams

⚠️ **Note**: These architecture diagrams were migrated from the original jumpstarter repository and may need updates to reflect the new monorepo structure and any changes made during the consolidation process.

## Files requiring review:

- `architecture.png` - Overall system architecture
- `router.png` - Router component architecture
- `rpc.png` - RPC communication architecture

These diagrams should be reviewed and updated as part of Phase 5 documentation consolidation to ensure they accurately represent the current state of the system after monorepo migration.
