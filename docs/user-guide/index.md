# User Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information on using Jumpstarter for testing and automation.

## Getting Started

### Basic Concepts

- **Device Under Test (DUT)**: The device being tested
- **Test Runner**: Executes test scenarios
- **Controller**: Manages test orchestration
- **Driver**: Interfaces with specific hardware

### Your First Test

1. Install Jumpstarter following the [Installation Guide](../installation/index.md)

2. Create a simple test configuration:

   ```yaml
   # test-config.yaml
   name: basic-test
   description: Basic device test

   devices:
     - name: my-device
       type: example-device

   tests:
     - name: power-on-test
       steps:
         - action: power-on
         - action: wait
           duration: 5s
         - action: check-status
   ```

3. Run the test:
   ```bash
   jumpstarter run test-config.yaml
   ```

## Configuration

### Device Configuration

Configure your devices in the device registry:

```yaml
devices:
  - name: raspberry-pi
    type: sbc
    connection:
      type: ssh
      host: 192.168.1.100
      username: pi
```

### Test Scenarios

Define test scenarios with YAML:

```yaml
scenarios:
  - name: boot-test
    description: Test device boot sequence
    steps:
      - action: power-cycle
      - action: wait-for-boot
        timeout: 60s
      - action: verify-services
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Drivers

Create custom drivers for your hardware:

```python
from jumpstarter.driver import BaseDriver

class MyCustomDriver(BaseDriver):
    def power_on(self):
        # Implementation
        pass

    def power_off(self):
        # Implementation
        pass
```

### Automation Pipelines

Integrate with CI/CD systems:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/hardware-test.yml
name: Hardware Tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run hardware tests
        run: jumpstarter run tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Problems**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify device credentials
   - Ensure firewall settings

2. **Driver Issues**
   - Verify driver installation
   - Check device compatibility
   - Review driver logs

3. **Test Failures**
   - Check test configuration
   - Verify device state
   - Review test logs

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```bash
jumpstarter --debug run test-config.yaml
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**: Group related tests logically
2. **Configuration Management**: Use version control for configurations
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in tests
4. **Documentation**: Document custom drivers and test scenarios
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for test infrastructure
